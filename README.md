# scheduleX
##### An AutoIt program to automate schedule input and assignment within the Paychex Time and Labor Online service

ScheduleX was created mid 2010 during my tenure as an Implementation Coordinator for the [Paychex](http://www.paychex.com/) [Time and Labor Online](http://www.paychex.com/payroll-taxes/time-labor-online.aspx) service. Within this position, there are times when numerous employee schedules will need to be manually inputted into the TLO service. When faced with one of these situations, I opted to automate it. Using [AutoIt](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/) (a BASIC-like scripting language), I created a program to automate schedule input and assignment from two Excel spreadsheets. ScheduleX was a big hit within the department and the executable was distributed among my colleagues.

I should have done this earlier as I'm no longer working in the department, but I've decided to open source scheduleX. Better late than never (and who knows, perhaps someone will pick it up and develop further).

## Setup
You'll need Aut2Exe to convert the script to an executable. Grab it [here](https://www.autoitscript.com/site/autoit/downloads/).
